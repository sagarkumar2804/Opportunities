    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our mission is to make internships accessible to all high school students. Currently, everyone can add high school internships to a master list. With more coding experience and time, we would like to add checkboxes so that certain internships show up according to the user's choice of location and category (such as coding or art). Our website makes finding high school internships easier because there is no one site dedicated to just high school internships. It also makes adding internships easier. </p>
